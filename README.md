Szlendak Showcase is a web application built using React that simulates the Instagram Stories interface. This application was initially created as a marketing portfolio for a recruitment task, but I will continue to develop the project in the future to be more versatile.

## Usage

[Click here](https://shlendakh.github.io/szlendak-showcase/) to see the final version.

## Features

* Responsive design that mimics Instagram Stories interface
* Swipe or click to navigate between stories
* The progress bar at the top indicates which story is currently active
* Support for content rendering using HTML and DOMPurify

## Disclaimer

The content of the tiles was created "on the fly" using an array containing HTML code. Despite using DOMPurify, this is not the best method of content management and I will be updating this in the future.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the app in development mode with `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser
